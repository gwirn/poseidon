This Plugin helps you to change between open buffers that have a name.

Example:

                                                        *poseidon.buffer_nav()*
poseidon.buffer_nav({full_set})
    If {full_set} is nil:
        Shows all buffers with the same file type as the current file >
        poseidon.buffer_nav()
<
    If {full_set} is any
        Shows all buffers that have name >
        poseidon.buffer_nav(1)
<
    Shows a floating window with all possible options.
    These can be navigated with vim modtions like any other file.

    To select a buffer and go to it:
        Navigate to the filepath in the floating window and press <CR>
    To close a buffer that's in the floating window:
        Navigate to the filepath in the floating window and press D<CR>
    To close the floating window without any action:
        Press <ESC>

    This keymappings get assigned when |poseidon.buffer_nav()| is used and reset
    afterwards to the keymappings that where there before. So it will change
    these mappings only for the time when the floating window is open.
